II. Presentation of the Two Tables
Before we explore the deeper logic behind the updated structure of prophylaxis, it is essential to place the two reference points side 
by side: the official table and the updated table. These two frameworks represent not only different moments in time, but different ways 
of understanding prevention itself.

1. The Official Table (Historical Model)

The official table was created in a context where the primary goal was to bring order to a field that lacked structure. It grouped 
preventive methods into categories that were, at the time, considered comprehensive and balanced. For many years, it served as a 
foundational reference — a starting point for education, practice, and public understanding.
However, the official table reflects the assumptions and limitations of its era. It was built on a narrower view of human behavior, a 
simpler model of health, and a world with fewer variables. Some methods were given disproportionate importance, others were overlooked, 
and several modern preventive components simply did not exist or were not recognized.

2. The Updated Table (Operational Model)

The updated table responds to the realities of contemporary life. It expands the scope of prophylaxis, recalibrates the weight of each 
method, and integrates components that have become essential in modern preventive practice. Rather than preserving the structure of the 
past, it reorganizes the field according to how prevention actually functions today.
This new table is not a correction of errors — it is an evolution. It acknowledges the complexity of human behavior, the diversity of 
preventive strategies, and the need for a model that is both accurate and functional. Each method is positioned according to its real 
impact, not its traditional status.

3. Why Present Them Together?
Showing the two tables side by side is not meant to create conflict between “old” and “new.” Instead, it highlights the natural 
progression of a living system. The official table represents the foundation; the updated table represents the refinement. Together, 
they illustrate how prophylaxis has grown, expanded, and adapted.
This dual presentation prepares the reader for the next stage of the lesson — the conceptual comparison and the deeper analysis of how 
and why the transition occurred. It sets the stage for understanding not only what has changed, but why those changes were necessary.
