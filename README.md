Welcome to the Prophylaxis Framework

This repository explores a layered approach to human prophylaxis — not just in the medical sense, but as a broader philosophy of prevention, alignment, and conscious living.

We challenge conventional models by introducing a dual perspective:

Felix — intuitive, experiential, and poetic
CoPi — systemic, structured, and didactic

Together, they offer a dynamic map for navigating health, energy, and awareness — from meridian work and Taoist sexuality to behavioral patterns and cognitive hygiene.

What you’ll find here
🧭 A reimagined distribution of prevention components
🧠 Didactic metaphors and ironic twists
📊 Tables, charts, and conceptual breakdowns
🔍 Lessons in progress — including meridian procedures and Taoist methods


About quitting smoking: 
“You don’t need to set your boat on fire to learn how to protect it. Prevention begins with the decision not to sabotage it — and continues with every conscious act that keeps it afloat.”
