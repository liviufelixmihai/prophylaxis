5. Argumentation of Weights

Assigning weight to each preventive method is not an arbitrary exercise. It reflects how prophylaxis operates in real life — how people 
behave, how risks accumulate, and how different strategies influence long‑term outcomes. The updated table does not simply redistribute 
percentages; it redefines the balance of the entire system based on functional relevance.

5.1. Central Methods vs. Complementary Methods
In any preventive framework, certain methods naturally rise to the center because they shape the foundation of long‑term well‑being. 
These are the methods that:
- influence daily behavior,
- have broad applicability across contexts,
- generate cumulative effects over time,
- and serve as prerequisites for other preventive actions.
Their weight is higher not because they are theoretically important, but because they are operationally unavoidable.
Complementary methods, on the other hand, play supportive roles. They are valuable, but their impact is narrower, more situational, 
or dependent on the presence of stronger foundational methods. Their weight reflects this reality.
Lower‑percentage methods are still indispensable, completing the prophylactic system and amplifying its effects through synergy.

5.2. The Logic Behind Recalibration
Recalibrating the weights means aligning the model with lived experience. For example:
A method that was historically emphasized may now be recognized as limited in scope.
A method once considered secondary may prove to have a profound influence on long‑term outcomes.
A method that was absent from the official table may now be essential due to new scientific understanding or societal changes.
The updated table acknowledges these shifts and assigns weight according to actual preventive power, not tradition.

5.3. The Role of Modern Evidence
Contemporary prophylaxis is informed by a broader range of data than ever before: behavioral science, psychology, social dynamics, 
environmental factors, and long‑term observational patterns. These insights reveal that prevention is not a single action, but a network 
of influences.
The updated weights reflect:
- how often a method is used,
- how deeply it affects behavior,
- how strongly it correlates with positive outcomes,
- and how essential it is for maintaining preventive balance.

5.4. Why the Updated Table Is More Accurate
The official table was built on a simplified model of human behavior. The updated table is built on a functional model — one that 
mirrors the complexity of real life. Its weights are not symbolic; they are operational.
This makes the updated table:
- more realistic,
- more coherent,
- more aligned with contemporary needs,
- and more useful as a practical guide.

5.5. Availability of Detailed Materials
Each preventive method included in the updated table is explored in depth in dedicated materials. These extended lessons provide 
definitions, mechanisms, examples, and practical applications, allowing readers to understand not only what each method represents, but 
how it works and why it carries its specific weight in the overall system.
This ensures that the updated table is not an isolated summary, but the gateway to a complete, structured body of knowledge.

5.6. The Purpose of Weighting
Weighting is not about ranking methods or declaring winners. It is about understanding the architecture of prophylaxis:
- what holds the system together,
- what amplifies its effects,
- what supports the structure,
- and what fills the gaps.
By assigning accurate weights, the updated table becomes not just a list of methods, but a map of influence — a tool that helps readers 
understand how prevention truly works.
