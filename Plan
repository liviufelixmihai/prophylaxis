✉️ 3. Draft the Email Template
Here’s a stylized version you can adapt:

Subject: Sponsorship Invitation – Join the Ritual of Laughter as Medicine

Body:

Dear [Sponsor Name],

I’m reaching out with a proposal that blends science, humor, and community: Laughter of the World — a digital platform that transforms laughter into preventive medicine.

Rooted in gelotherapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and modern neuroscience, our project offers:

Daily ritual jokes for emotional and digestive activation


Collective challenges to propagate laughter

A community space for resonance, not just reaction

We’re seeking visionary sponsors who believe in emotional health, poetic technology, and social harmonization. Your support would help us launch and expand this initiative — and align your brand with a movement that heals through vibration.

I’ve attached a brief overview of the platform and sponsorship options. I’d be honored to discuss further.

With gratitude and a hohot, Liviu Mihai [Contact Info]
