3. Conceptual Visual Structure
Before entering the deeper analysis of how the transition from the official table to the updated table took place, it is helpful to 
offer the reader a simple, intuitive visual framework. This structure is not numerical and does not attempt to quantify differences. 
Instead, it provides a conceptual map — a way to see, at a glance, how the two models relate to one another.
The goal here is not to explain, but to orient.
Not to argue, but to prepare the ground for argument.
Not to persuade, but to open the space in which persuasion will happen.
1. A Side‑by‑Side Conceptual View

Official Table (Historical Model)        →        Updated Table (Operational Model)
──────────────────────────────────                 ──────────────────────────────────
• Missing methods                                 • Newly introduced components
• Overestimated methods                           • Recalibrated to real impact
• Underestimated methods                          • Elevated to their true weight
• Static structure                                • Dynamic, functional structure
• Fragmented categories                           • Integrated, interconnected system

This visual comparison is intentionally minimal.
It does not reveal the details — it reveals the logic of the transition.
2. Why This Structure Works
It avoids overwhelming the reader with numbers or technicalities.
It highlights the nature of the evolution rather than the mechanics.
It creates a mental framework that makes the upcoming analysis easier to follow.
It preserves the narrative flow of the lesson by keeping the focus on ideas, not data.
It prepares the reader for the “debate moment” without pre‑empting it.
3. The Role of This Section in the Lesson
This conceptual structure acts as a bridge between the presentation of the two tables and the deeper exploration that follows. It gives 
the reader a sense of direction — a map of the terrain — without yet walking them through the details.
It is the moment where the reader begins to understand that the transition from the official table to the updated table is not cosmetic, 
but structural. Not a correction, but a re‑alignment. Not a replacement, but an evolution.
