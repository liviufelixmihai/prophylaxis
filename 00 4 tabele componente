4. The Debate Moment

The transition from the official table to the updated table cannot be understood through numbers alone. It requires a deeper examination 
— a moment of honest debate, where each method is questioned, each assumption is revisited, and each component is evaluated according to 
its real impact. This section is not a confrontation between “old” and “new,” but a guided exploration of how prophylaxis has evolved 
and why the updated model reflects reality more accurately.

4.1. What No Longer Fits the Present
The first step in this debate is recognizing the limitations of the historical model. Certain methods that once seemed central no longer 
hold the same weight in modern preventive practice. Their importance has shifted, not because they were wrong, but because the world 
around them has changed. New pressures, new behaviors, and new forms of risk demand a different balance.
Some methods were overemphasized simply because they were familiar. Others were underestimated because their long‑term impact was not 
yet understood. The official table reflects the knowledge of its time — and its time has passed.

4.2. What the Updated Table Captures
The updated table introduces components that have become essential in contemporary prophylaxis. These are not additions for the sake of 
expansion, but responses to real needs:
methods that address modern lifestyle patterns,
methods that reflect new scientific understanding,
methods that fill conceptual gaps left by the older model.
Each new component answers a question that the official table could not address. Each recalibrated method reflects a more accurate 
understanding of how prevention works in practice.

4.3. Why Certain Methods Rise in Importance
Some preventive strategies have proven themselves to be far more influential than previously recognized. Their role in shaping long‑term 
outcomes, their relevance in daily life, and their ability to influence behavior justify a higher position in the updated model.
These methods rise not because we favor them, but because reality does.

4.4. Why Others Decline
Conversely, certain methods lose weight in the updated table. This does not diminish their value; it simply places them in proportion to 
their actual impact. A method that once seemed central may now play a supporting role. A method that was once considered universal may 
now be context‑dependent.
Recalibration is not criticism — it is accuracy.

4.5. Filling the Conceptual Gaps
One of the most important outcomes of this debate is the identification of missing elements. The official table, despite its historical 
value, left several areas unaddressed. The updated table fills these gaps by introducing methods that:
reflect modern understanding of human behavior,
integrate psychological, social, and environmental factors,
create a more complete and functional preventive system.
Excluding Non‑Prophylactic Components

4.6. Some elements present in the official table — such as the percentage assigned to quitting smoking — were removed in the updated model. 
These components do not represent authentic prophylactic methods. They describe the cessation of self‑sabotage, not preventive action. 
Prophylaxis is defined by constructive, forward‑oriented strategies, and the updated table reflects this distinction.

4.7. The Purpose of the Debate
This debate is not about proving the old model wrong. It is about showing how prophylaxis grows. It is about understanding why the 
updated table is not a replacement, but a continuation — a more precise, more coherent, and more operational version of the same mission.
The debate moment is where the reader begins to see the logic behind the evolution. It is where the transition becomes not only 
reasonable, but inevitable.
