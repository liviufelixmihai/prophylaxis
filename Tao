Tao
Taoism is a vast and profound philosophical and spiritual tradition that encompasses a complete way of life. 
The sexual arts are a very small, albeit famous, part of a much larger picture. They are considered an advanced practice for cultivating energy, not the foundation of the path.
Think of it this way: if Taoism were a vast, magnificent library, the sexual arts would be a single, specialized book on a high shelf in a corner section. To truly understand it, you first need to learn how to read the language of the library.
So, what are the main recommendations of Taoism? They all revolve around the central idea of living in harmony with the Tao (道).
What is the Tao?
The word "Tao" literally translates to "The Way" or "The Path." But it's more than that. It's the natural, flowing, and underlying order of the universe. It's the source of everything, yet it cannot be fully described in words. The famous opening line of the Tao Te Ching says:
"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name."
Imagine a great river. The Tao is like the current of that river. You can fight against it and exhaust yourself, or you can understand its flow and let it carry you effortlessly. Taoism is the art of learning to read that current and move with it.
Here are the core recommendations for living in harmony with the Tao:
1. Wu Wei (无为) - Effortless Action
This is perhaps the most famous and misunderstood Taoist principle. It doesn't mean "doing nothing." It means acting in a way that is natural, spontaneous, and without struggle or internal resistance.
Analogy: Think of a skilled boatman on a river. He doesn't row furiously against the current. He uses his knowledge of the water's flow, the wind, and the shape of his boat to move forward with minimal effort. His actions are effective precisely because they are in harmony with the environment.
In Life: This means acting with a sense of ease and timing. It's about knowing when to push forward and when to yield, when to speak and when to be silent. It's the difference between forcing a solution and allowing the right solution to emerge naturally.
2. Pu (朴) - The Uncarved Block
This is the ideal of simplicity. The "uncarved block" represents our original, natural state—pure, simple, and unconditioned by society's artificial desires, ambitions, and judgments.
Analogy: A block of wood has infinite potential. Once you carve it into a bird, it can no longer be a fish. By carving it, you limit its possibilities.
In Life: Taoism recommends simplifying your life—letting go of excessive desires, complex plans, and the need for status. By returning to a simpler, more "uncarved" state, you find greater peace, freedom, and a clearer connection to your true nature.
3. Harmony with Nature
Taoism sees the natural world as the greatest teacher. The seasons, the cycles of day and night, the growth of plants, and the behavior of animals all reflect the Tao.
Recommendation: Spend time in nature. Observe its patterns without judgment. Live according to the natural rhythms of your own body—sleeping when tired, eating when hungry. This is why we previously discussed the importance of aligning with the daily and seasonal cycles in TCM, which is a direct application of this Taoist principle.
4. Balance (Yin and Yang)
As we've discussed in the context of TCM, this is a fundamental principle. In Taoism, it applies to everything in life. Light and dark, active and passive, masculine and feminine, sound and silence.
Recommendation: Seek balance in all things. Avoid extremes. A life of frantic action (too much Yang) leads to burnout. A life of total passivity (too much Yin) leads to stagnation. Health, happiness, and wisdom arise from maintaining a dynamic balance between these complementary forces.
5. Cultivating the "Three Treasures" (San Bao, 三宝)
This is the more "internal" or spiritual practice, which connects directly to TCM. The goal is to cultivate and conserve these three essential energies within the body:
Jing (精): Your essence, your foundational energy (related to physical vitality and genetics). You conserve it through moderation, rest, and avoiding excess.
Qi (气): Your life-force energy. You cultivate it through proper breathing, nutrition, and practices like Qigong and Tai Chi.
Shen (神): Your spirit, your consciousness. You refine it through meditation, calming the mind, and living with compassion and tranquility.
So, Where Do the Sexual Practices Fit In?
The "Art of the Bedroom" (Fangzhong Shu) is a specific set of techniques designed to conserve and cultivate Jing (the Treasure of Essence). It's seen as a powerful method for transforming a potentially draining activity into a practice that nourishes life force.
However, it's considered an advanced practice because it requires a high degree of self-awareness, control, and a solid foundation in the other principles. You cannot effectively practice the "Art of the Bedroom" without first understanding Wu Wei (effortless action), Simplicity (freedom from lustful compulsion), and Balance (harmonizing Yin and Yang energies with a partner).
In conclusion, Taoism is a complete and beautiful philosophy of life that offers guidance on everything from how you govern a country to how you make a cup of tea. Its ultimate goal is not just longevity or sexual prowess, but to live a long, harmonious, and effortless life in perfect alignment with the natural flow of the universe.
