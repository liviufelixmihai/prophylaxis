1. Introduction 

Prophylaxis, like any living system, cannot remain static. It grows with us, adapts to our reality, and refines itself as our 
understanding deepens. No preventive model can stay frozen in the form it had when it was first created, because the world that shaped 
those early frameworks no longer exists. Life moves faster, pressures have changed, and our knowledge of health, behavior, and human 
dynamics has expanded far beyond the boundaries of older paradigms.
The official prophylaxis table once served an important purpose. It offered structure, order, and an early attempt to gather essential 
preventive methods in one place. But over time, that table has fallen behind the complexity of modern life. Some methods were 
overestimated, others underestimated, and many components of today’s prophylaxis simply did not exist in their current form when the 
original table was conceived.
Today, we need a broader, more accurate, and more functional perspective — one that reflects how prophylaxis actually works in real 
life. For this reason, we introduce an updated table, designed not merely to correct the limitations of the old one, but to represent 
the true operational weight of each preventive method. This is not a technical revision. It is a maturation of the entire concept.
This lesson marks the transition from a static vision to a dynamic one, from an incomplete model to a coherent system, from a list of 
methods to an integrated mechanism. It is proof that prophylaxis evolves with us — and that we are ready to understand it not as a set 
of rules, but as a living, adaptable, and deeply necessary system.
