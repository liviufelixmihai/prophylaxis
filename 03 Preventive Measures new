# Preventive Measures and General Prophylaxis

Conflict Opening – Draft
Most people think they already understand prevention. They nod confidently, as if the topic were a polite formality — like washing your 
hands or eating one more salad.
But here’s the uncomfortable truth: if prevention were truly understood, half of our daily problems wouldn’t exist. And yet they do. 
Which means someone is wrong. Either the world is broken… or our idea of prevention is.
Let’s test that.
You say you “take care of yourself”. Good. Then why do small problems keep surprising you like uninvited guests? Why does your body 
negotiate truces you never signed? Why does your energy collapse exactly when you need it most?
Something doesn’t add up. And that “something” is the gap between what we think prevention is… and what prevention actually requires.
This lesson is about closing that gap — clearly, honestly, and without the usual sugar‑coating.

Before we rebuild prevention properly, we need to acknowledge the official model — the one found in textbooks, guidelines, and public 
health documents. It’s the model everyone quotes, the model everyone assumes is complete, the model that looks authoritative simply 
because it has a stamp on it.
But here’s the problem: official doesn’t always mean sufficient. Sometimes it only means “old enough to be accepted and too old to be 
questioned”.
The standard distribution of preventive measures is usually presented as a clean, orderly list — primary, secondary, tertiary prevention, 
plus a few general recommendations. It sounds structured. It sounds scientific. It sounds like the whole story.
Except it isn’t.
Important components are missing — not obscure, not experimental, not controversial — just… ignored. Fitotherapy, for example, is one of 
the oldest and most widely used preventive tools in human history. Yet it rarely appears in the official scheme, as if millions of 
people and thousands of years of practice were a footnote.
So yes, we will present the official distribution. We respect it as a reference point. 
But we won’t pretend it’s complete. 
In the rest of this lesson, we will rebuild prevention with all its real components — the ones people use, the ones that work, and the 
ones that modern frameworks forgot to include.

The official table belongs to an earlier generation of prevention — a generation built on linear templates, uniform procedures, and the 
assumption that people can be guided through identical steps. It reflects a time when standardization was considered efficiency, and 
individuality was treated as noise. The table is not wrong; it is simply limited. It cannot account for personal evolution, for 
complexity, for the dynamic nature of real life. It offers structure, but not adaptability. It organizes information, but it does not 
develop the person.
From this point forward, we move beyond the table. Not to dismiss it, but to surpass it — to replace linear templates with personal 
growth, uniform steps with multidimensional development, and rigid procedures with a living, adaptive process of prophylaxis.
