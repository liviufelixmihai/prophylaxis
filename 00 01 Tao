1. Introduction: Tao as a Connection to Life 

Tao is a beautiful philosophy of life — a way of seeing the world that offers guidance for everything we do. At its essence, Tao is 
the natural, effortless connection between an individual and life itself. It is both the connection and the ongoing process of 
aligning ourselves with it.

A useful distinction here is between connection and alignment:
connection is the bond, the link; alignment is the continuous adjustment that keeps this bond clear, fluid, and alive.

Of course, any definition of Tao has its limits — as the classic saying reminds us, the moment you try to define Tao, you step 
outside of it. Still, a practical definition helps us work with Tao in daily life.

Tao can also be understood as the rhythm of life. Health, in this sense, is the ability to move with that rhythm rather than against 
it. Tao works through non‑forcing, through allowing rather than pushing.

In medicine — which is simply another expression of life — Tao aligns naturally with prophylaxis and with the body’s natural state. 
Tao cannot align with repair, because repair begins only after the natural flow has already been disrupted.
Seen this way, Tao becomes a guide for avoiding health problems, which is ultimately a guide for preserving health.
