6. Conclusion

The transition from the official table to the updated table is not a rejection of the past, but a continuation of it. Every preventive 
model begins as an attempt to bring clarity to complexity, and the official table fulfilled that role in its time. It offered structure, 
direction, and a first framework for understanding prophylaxis as a coherent field.
But no system designed for a previous era can fully serve the needs of the present. As life evolves, prevention must evolve with it. The 
updated table reflects this natural progression. It integrates new knowledge, recalibrates old assumptions, and aligns the entire 
structure with the realities of contemporary life.
This evolution is not cosmetic. It is conceptual.
It is not a correction. It is a maturation.
It is not a break from tradition. It is the next step in its development.
The updated table provides a more accurate, more functional, and more complete representation of how prophylaxis operates today. It 
acknowledges the central methods that shape long‑term outcomes, the auxiliary methods that support them, and the new components that 
fill the gaps left by earlier models. It transforms prevention from a static list into a living, interconnected mechanism.
Readers are invited not only to understand this evolution, but to participate in it. Prophylaxis is not a fixed doctrine; it is a 
dynamic system that grows with us, adapts to our needs, and becomes more precise as our understanding deepens. The updated table is a 
reflection of this growth — and a foundation for everything that follows.
